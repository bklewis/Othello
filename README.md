Welcome to the game of Othello!

Written by Bryce Lewis, Jia Li, and Emily Williams for Professor Jia Tao's Spring 2014 Programming Paradigms class at Bryn Mawr College

The Goal:
The goal of the game is to have more of your tokens on the board than your opponent does by the end of the game.

Rules:
1. You may only move somewhere where you will "capture" at least one of your opponent's tokens.
2. Tokens are captured when they are between two of the opposing tokens on any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line.
3. If you cannot move, your turn is passed.
4. If neither player can move, the game is over.

Setup:
When you start a game you will be prompted to choose one of three options:
	1: Human vs. Computer
	2: Human vs. Human
	3: Computer vs. Computer
In mode (1) you will play against the computer's AI.  In mode (2) you can play against a friend.  In mode (3) watch the computer play itself!
The game board starts with the central four spaces taken- two by X and two by O.
The first player will be randomly selected at the start of each game.



Enjoy the game!
