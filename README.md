Welcome to the game of Othello!

Written by Bryce Lewis, Jia Li, and Emily Williams for Professor Jia Tao's Spring 2014 Programming Paradigms class at Bryn Mawr College

The Goal:
The goal of the game is to have more of your tokens on the board than your opponent does by the end of the game.

Rules:
1. You may only move somewhere where you will "capture" at least one of your opponent's tokens.
2. Tokens are captured when they are between two of the opposing tokens on any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line.
3. If you cannot move, your turn is passed.
4. If neither player can move, the game is over.

Setup:
When you start a game you will be prompted to choose one of three options:
	1: Human vs. Computer
	2: Human vs. Human
	3: Computer vs. Computer
In mode (1) you will play against the computer's AI.  In mode (2) you can play against a friend.  In mode (3) watch the computer play itself!
The game board starts with the central four spaces taken- two by X and two by O.
The first player will be randomly selected at the start of each game.



Enjoy the game!


Othello is a two-person game played with 64 tokens on an eight-by-eight grid.  
Each token has two sides, X and O, each of which represents a player.  The goal 
of the game is to have more tokens of your mark than your opponent's mark on 
the grid by the end of the game.

To begin, the central four squares of the board will be filled  with four tokens:
O on the the upper left and bottom right corners, and X on the upper right and 
bottom left corners. 

To make a move, a player must place a token of their color on an empty space 
ajacent to a token of the opponent's color (horizontally, vertically, or 
diagonally) in such a way that one or more of the opponent's tokens are 
sandwiched between the new token and a "base" token (any of the current 
player's tokens already on the board).  There can be no empty spaces in the 
squares between the new and base tokens.  All of the tokens between the new 
and base tokens are then flipped to the current player's color, and the turn 
is over.   If a player cannot place a token in a way that meets these 
conditions, their turn is passed and the next player may move.  If neither 
player can make a move, no matter how many tokens are on the board, the game 
is over.  The winner is the one with the most token in their color on the board 
when the game ends.
