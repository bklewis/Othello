Welcome to the game of Othello!

Written by Bryce Lewis, Jia Li, and Emily Williams for Professor Jia Tao's Spring 2014 Programming Paradigms class at Bryn Mawr College

The Game:

Othello is a two-person game played with 64 tokens on an eight-by-eight grid.
Each token has two sides, X and O, each of which represents a player.  The goal
of the game is to have more tokens of your mark than your opponent's mark on
the grid by the end of the game.

Gameplay:

To begin, the central four squares of the board will be filled with four tokens:
O on the the upper left and bottom right corners, and X on the upper right and
bottom left corners.

To make a move, a player must place a token of their symbol on an empty space
ajacent to a token of the opponent's color (horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally) in such a way that one or more of the opponent's tokens are
sandwiched between the new token and a "base" token (any of the current
player's tokens already on the board).  There can be no empty spaces in the
squares between the new and base tokens.  All of the tokens between the new
and base tokens are then flipped to the current player's symbol, and the turn
is over.  If a player cannot place a token in a way that meets these
conditions, their turn is passed and the next player may move.  If neither
player can make a move, no matter how many tokens are on the board, the game
is over.  The winner is the one with the most tokens with their symbol on the board
when the game ends.

Starting a Game: 

When you start a game you will be prompted to choose one of three options: (1) Human vs. Computer, (2) Human vs. Human, or (3) Computer vs. Computer
Choose mode (1) to play against the computer's AI or mode (2) to play against a friend.  Choose mode (3) to watch the computer play itself!  
The first player will be randomly selected at the start of each game.  

Enjoy the game!
